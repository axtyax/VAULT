The 'testing' directory contains code that serves as a basic demo
of the viability of the algorithm.

General Notes / Ideas:

	- The algorithm is essentially a perfect hashing algorithm. The objective is to map a space of strings to a smaller space of integer timestamps
		- Timestamps should be expressed in minutes after the very first document is pushed

	- Documents of words (in the same language, at least) contain many commonalities. The algorithm could adapt to slightly modify existing routines
	  accomodate new documents, on the basis that slight word changes cause changes in output timestamp.


Algorithm Notes / Ideas:
	
	- An adaptive "operation stack", where some number of operations are performed successively throughout each input string
